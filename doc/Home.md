This is the wiki for upm-server (oh I did totally not know that!)

The upm server does the following:
 * Given an identifier, send the matching package to the user
 * Lock package names with a password
 * Synchronize with other servers
 * Let server maintainer check if package is ok (like having a flag for each package, i dunno)
