# Title

To create a proposal, copy this template proposal to your fork, replace the texts in the sections, remove this section, save it as proposals/0000-&lt;proposal name&gt;.md, and make a pull request. **The pull request (and forking) is important, so that the proposal can be discussed and optionally rejected!**

## Motivation  
Explain here, why you are making this proposal.  
Which problem does it solve?  

## Short and understandable summary
Purpose here: make the human understand.
Summarize the proposal here so that it is understandable. Explain to a person who does not know anything about this issue!  
Provide all the information that is *necessary*. Don't give too much, but also not too few.  

## Advantages
Why is your proposal good, and better than the existing methods (if any)?

## Disadvantages
Yes, we're not all perfect. Find the bad things in your proposal!  
This is also good because it makes you reading your proposal again!

## Alternatives  
Other ways to accomplish what you propose.  
Why and why not choose these ways?

## Unresolved questions
All the stuff that is still to be discussed and decided, or other holes in your proposal.  

## Detailed explanation
Now, you can (you have to) provide *all* the information, so that it is implementable  
without having the implementor to guess or interpret.  
However, that does not mean you don't have to structure it ;)
